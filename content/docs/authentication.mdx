## Authentication System

The Authentication System is designed as a centralized user identity service that handles login, registration, and access control. It implements real-world authentication workflows such as secure password handling, session management, and OAuth integration.

This project demonstrates how production-ready authentication systems are structured and deployed using modern web technologies.


## Key Features

- Secure user signup and login system  
- Password encryption and validation  
- OAuth social login (Google)  
- Session handling and access control  
- Protected routes for authorized users only  
- Scalable authentication structure  
- Clean and responsive UI  
- Production deployment on custom subdomain  

## Conclusion

This project strengthened my understanding of authentication logic, backend security, and system design. It reflects how modern applications handle identity and access management at scale and serves as a foundation for integrating authentication into future projects.
