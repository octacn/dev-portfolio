This project transforms the boring new tab page into a visually appealing dashboard that provides:

- A distraction-free UI
- Quick-access shortcuts
- Fast load speed
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Minimal animations for a smooth user experience

The goal was to create something that feels instant, modern, and professionally designed while remaining extremely lightweight.
